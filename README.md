# Pump Clone

This is a simple project inspired by pump.fun. It allows you to list and create tokens in a basic web interface.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Debug

The endpoint `/debug` returns the current token list for testing.
